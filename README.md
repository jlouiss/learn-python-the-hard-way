#[Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book)

##Notes

###Ex. 7 - *More Printing*
```python
print 'This is an %r' % 'example'
```
will print out 
`This is an 'example'`

`%r` will display *raw* data, `%r` is best for debugging.

---

###Ex. 10 - *What Was That?*
####**Escape Sequences**
Escape       | What it does
------------ | ------------
`\a`         | ASCII bell (BEL)
`\b`         | ASCII backspace (BS)
`\f`         | ASCII formfeed (FF)
`\N(name)`   | Unicode character
`\r`         | Carriage Return (CR)
`\t`         | Horizontal tab (TAB)
`\v`         | ASCII Vertical tab (VT)
`\ooo`       | Character with octal value ooo
`\xhh`       | Chacarter with hex value hh
`\uxxxx`     | 16-bit hex value xxxx (Unicode)
`\uxxxxxxxx` | 32-bit hex value xxxx (Unicode)

###Ex. 11 - *Asking Questions*
`input()` function will try to convert things you enter as if they were Python code.
`raw_input()` is *safer* than `input()`

---

###Ex. 12 - *Prompting People*
The built-in function `help()` invokes the online help system in the interactive interpreter, which uses pydoc to generate its documentation as text on the console. 
The same text documentation can also be viewed from *outside* the Python interpreter by running `pydoc` as a script at the operating systemâ€™s command prompt. 
For example, running
`$ pydoc sys`
will display documentation on the sys module

---

###Ex. 13 - *Parameters, Unpacking, Variables*
```python
from sys import argv
script, first, second, third = argv
```
`argv` *holds* the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it.
